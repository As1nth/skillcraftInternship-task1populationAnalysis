ðŸ“Š Indiaâ€™s Population Distribution by Age â€“ 2022
This project visualizes Indiaâ€™s population distribution by age group for the year 2022 using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The data is presented in a clean and insightful bar chart that helps understand how the population is segmented by age.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I built this visualization to represent how India's 1.42 billion people are distributed across key age categories:

0 to 20 Years â€“ 36.1%
21 to 64 Years â€“ 57.0%
65+ Years â€“ 6.9%
The visualization includes:

Percentage of population per age group
Total population annotation
Median age annotation
Color-coded bars
